We are building an OCLIF-based CLI tool that interacts with the OpenAI API and includes features like:

1. **Sending requests to the OpenAI API** â€“ Using GPT-4o for conversational AI responses.
2. **Storing conversation history** â€“ Saving user prompts and AI responses in a local history file.
3. **Managing API keys and user configuration** â€“ Allowing users to save their OpenAI API key and email for seamless authentication.
4. **Viewing conversation history** â€“ Enabling users to review their previous questions and responses with an option to filter only questions.
5. **Pretty-printing code blocks in responses** â€“ Formatting and highlighting code blocks correctly for better readability on the command line.
6. **Support for ES module standards** â€“ Ensuring compliance with modern JavaScript/ESM syntax.

Next Steps:
- Improving conversational history tracking (e.g., resuming conversations).
- Implementing a command for clearing history.
- Adding support for more formatting options.
- Allowing users to configure additional OpenAI model settings.
